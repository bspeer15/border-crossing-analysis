# border-crossing-analysis

Requirements: sbt ( Scala Build Tool ) needs to be installed in order to run the script

Note: my code is in src/main/scala because that is where sbt needs it to be

My script will always process ./input/Border_Crossing_Entry_Data.csv

There are other files in the ./input folder. When I want to test other files 
I simply overwrite Border_Crossing_Entry_Data.csv with a larger file.

Results are always written to ./output/report.csv
